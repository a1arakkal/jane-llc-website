    At JANE LLC, our mission is to advance biostatistics research and its real-world application in healthcare. This mission is deeply personal â€” it is inspired by my mother, JANE, who dedicated her life to helping others and whose battle with breast cancer shaped my commitment to this work. Her strength and resilience drive our focus on improving patient outcomes through innovation in medical research. By leveraging data-driven insights, we honor her legacy by providing expert biostatistical consulting that supports healthcare research aimed at being more effective, equitable, and compassionate.
